<p><m>\textbf{Summary:}</m> As individuals who value reflective practice in education, we chose to document our journey as Ramsey theory students. </p>
<p>By documenting our experience in MATH 303, we hope to show how we have applied what we have learned to areas beyond the classroom. Specifically, we aim to share instances where some of the Ramsey theory ideas may appear in our everyday lives. We want to highlight specific areas of Ramsey theory that we find difficult or have particular interest in by creating focused posts about them on our Instagram page. Such posts may contain extra research on mathematical figures and their theorems, as well as applications of our knowledge to challenge questions. 
</p>
<p>
Instagram is our social media platform of choice because we are able to demonstrate different formats of learning, including videos, pictures, and words. Instagram allows us to interact with our audience in the comments sections of our posts, creating a medium in which connections can be made with those who are interested in Ramsey theory and our experience learning about Ramsey theory!
