<p><m>\textbf{Summary:}</m> Life of Frank Ramsey still has not been presented in a way that the world wants to see. There is very little, or no information presented in form of a video on YouTube. After doing some research and finding articles related to the life of Frank Ramsey, we found there is no animation related to Ramsey's life. So, our aim was to create an animated video about the life story of Frank Ramsey, with the team members narrating about the various phases of Ramsey's life. Frank Ramsey's life was very diverse as he contributed to many different fields. We have taken into account several phases of his life, such as early life, education, contributions to various fields like mathematics, economics, and philosophy, as well as his personal life.

In the animation we briefly explain the Pigeonhole Principle and a special case of Ramsey's theorem.
