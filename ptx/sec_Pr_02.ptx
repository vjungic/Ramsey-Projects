<title>Ramsey and Friends: A Story of Ramsey Theory</title>


<introduction>
<title>Project by: <em>Manroop Rai</em>,  <em>Jason Su</em>, <em>Elison Tong</em>, and <em>Ashley Triebwasser</em></title>
</introduction>
<p><m>\textbf{Summary:}</m> The main goal of our final project was to create a story, aimed at children, explaining a little bit about Ramsey's theorem, Schur's theorem, van der Waerden's theorem, and Erd&#337;s -Szekeres' theorem. We wanted to create a story that simplified the main theories that contributed to Ramsey theory in a way that would be accessible to younger audiences. We also wanted to create simple and colourful pictures to accompany the text so that the explanations were engaging. This would allow for more understanding of the theorems by children who can't learn from text alone. Our original intention was to create a hard copy printed version of the book but due to COVID, none of us felt comfortable going to the print shop. We decided using slides would suffice as an electronic storybook. As a group we feel we accomplished our goal of making a story book aimed at children that summarized a few of the theorems contributing to Ramsey theory.
